Michaela & Dave are going to be married on *May 31st 2104* in a simple, yet special ceremony in Wairarapa.

### The Beginning

We are putting on a coach, with 2 pickup points:

* If you choose to take the train, the coach will pick you up from Featherston Train Station at 10:15am.
* If you choose to drive, park at [Peppers Parehua, Martinborough](http://www.peppers.co.nz/parehua/), the coach will pick you up at 10:30am.    

The coach will then take you Gladstone Church.
