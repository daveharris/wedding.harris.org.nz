There are quite a few nice places for accommodation in the Martinborough/Greytown area. We recommend:

* [Acorn Estate Motel, Greytown](http://www.acornestate.co.nz) - Our recommended motel. Nice utils and a short 20km drive from the reception.
* [Peppers Parehua, Martinborough](http://www.peppers.co.nz/parehua) - Very nice but very expensive. Has benefit of being where reception is so no need to drive. Say you are part of our wedding and get a Winemaker's Cottege for $235/night
* [Masterton Motor Lodge](http://www.masterton-motorlodge.co.nz) - Nice units, a 30 min drive from the reception though
