There are quite a few nice places for accommodation in the Martinborough/Greytown area if you wish to stay overnight.

However, it is Queen's Birthday weekend so it will pay to book early.

We recommend:

* Various houses/apartments in Martinborough on [Book a Bach](http://www.bookabach.co.nz/baches-and-holiday-homes/search/locale/martinborough)
* [Acorn Estate Motel, Greytown](http://www.acornestate.co.nz) - Our recommended motel. Nice units and a short 20km drive from the reception.
* [Masterton Motor Lodge](http://www.masterton-motorlodge.co.nz) - Nice units, a 30 min drive from the reception though
* This is a test
